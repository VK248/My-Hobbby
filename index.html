    <p> My Hobby Is Playing Football Because It Makes Me Feel Active And It Makes Me Very Happy. I Play Football In My School, After School And At  Night. I Also Started A Football Club In My School Which Helps Others In Football. I Started Playing Football When I Was 5 Years Old. I Continue Playing Football And I Never Seem To Stop Enjoying Playing Football. Football Helps Be Active And Can Help Develop Life And Pitch Skills Like Teamwork. Watching Other People Playing Foootball On TV Makes Me Feel More Commited Towards Playing Football.</p>
